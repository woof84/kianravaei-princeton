                    <p><b>Kian Ravaei</b> <a value="PLAY" onclick="play()">ðŸ”Š</a> composes music that delivers heartfelt directness, bold melodies, and visceral power. His growing body of work has often been praised for combining rigorous compositional technique with naturalness and penetrating emotion.</p>
                    <p>During the first year of the pandemic, Ravaeiâ€™s daily ritual was playing a chorale by J.S. Bach at the piano and composing an original chorale. Three hundred seventy-one chorales later, Ravaei has cultivated a deeply personal harmonic language and an obsession with the art of counterpoint. Like Bachâ€™s chorales, many of Ravaeiâ€™s works appear to be simple on the surface, but underneath they are rich and filled with unexpected nuance.</p>
                    <p>Born in 1999 of Iranian immigrants, Ravaei spent his childhood playing jazz, producing electronic dance music, and singing in a rock band when he should have been practicing piano sonatas. His diverse output has included a book of piano preludes inspired by mythical creatures, a string quartet that synthesizes Western and Persian classical music, and an orchestration for dubstep DJ and producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooli" target="_blank">Wooli</a>.</p>
                    <p>Ravaeiâ€™s music has been performed by leading musicians such as violinist <a href="https://www.bellahristova.com/" target="_blank">Bella Hristova</a>, guitarist <a href="http://jijiguitar.com/" target="_blank">JIJI</a>, and pianists <a href="https://www.stefanogreco.com/en/" target="_blank">Stefano Greco</a> and <a href="https://jihyechang.com/" target="_blank">Jihye Chang</a>. He has been commissioned by notable organizations and ensembles such as the <a href="https://cmccanada.org/" target="_blank">Canadian Music Centre</a> and <a href="https://www.salastina.org/" target="_blank">Salastina.</a></p>
                    <p>As of the 2021/22 season, Ravaei is a newly appointed <a href="https://www.laco.org/people/kian-ravaei/" target="_blank">Composer Teaching Artist Fellow</a> with the <a href="https://laco.org/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</a>. He is an alum of the <a href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="_blank">Curtis Institute of Music</a> Young Artist Summer Program, and he counts prominent composers such as <a href="https://www.tarikoregan.com/" target="_blank">Tarik Oâ€™Regan</a>, <a href="https://www.derrickskye.com/" target="_blank">Derrick Skye</a>, <a href="https://kayrhie.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kay Rhie</a>, and <a href="https://www.juanpablocontreras.com/" target="_blank">Juan Pablo Contreras</a> among his past mentors.</p>
                    <p>He makes his home in Los Angeles, where he studies music composition with <a href="https://www.richard-danielpour.com/" target="_blank">Richard Danielpour</a> â€” one of his favorite living composers â€” at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. When he is not composing, he likes to jog, read short stories, and collect CDs.</p>

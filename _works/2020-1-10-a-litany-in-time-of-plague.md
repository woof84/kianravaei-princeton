It is astonishing and unfortunate how aptly these lines of Thomas Nashe, composed over 400 years ago, speak to the condition of humanity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">Adieu, farewell, earth's bliss;<br>
This world uncertain is;<br>
Fond are life's lustful joys;<br>
Death proves them all but toys;<br>
None from his darts can fly;<br>
I am sick, I must die.<br>
<span style="margin-left:10%;">Lord, have mercy on us!</span></p>
    </div>
</blockquote>

Suddenly, we all find ourselves imploring this invisible enemy to “have mercy on us.” I wrote this piece to mourn the countless dead, echo the existential fear of the living, and offer, with utmost sincerity, hope for the future.

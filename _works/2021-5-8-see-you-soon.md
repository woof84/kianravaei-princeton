At the time when Hypotenuse Trio commissioned this piece, it was on my heart to write an elegy dedicated to the memory of my late friend. He loved Les Mis√©rables and Michael Jackson, so I wove them into the fabric of the melody. Each member of the ensemble gets to play on their own and with each other, reminding us that we are in company even when alone.

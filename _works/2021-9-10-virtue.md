<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,<br>
The bridal of the earth and sky;<br>
The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,<br>
For thou must die.<br>
<br>
Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave<br>
Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye;<br>
Thy root is ever in its grave,<br>
And thou must die.<br>
<br>
Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,<br>
A box where sweets compacted lie;<br>
My music shows ye have your closes,<br>
And all must die.<br>
<br>
Only a sweet and virtuous soul,<br>
Like season'd timber, never gives;<br>
But though the whole world turn to coal,<br>
Then chiefly lives.<br>
<cite style="text-align:right;">George Herbert, "Virtue" (1633)</cite></p>

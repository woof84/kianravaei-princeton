Composers of every generation have written pieces inspired by the vernacular music of their time. Bach wrote gigues and allemandes; Chopin wrote waltzes and mazurkas.

In this piece I wanted to pay homage to one my favorite modern vernacular musics: pop musical theater. Think _Company_. _Wicked_. _Legally Blonde_.

This piece is made up of fragments of musical theater, disjointed recollections of shows once seen. It is also a showpiece for the trombone, making use of the instrument's capacity for vigor, jocularity, and lyricism.

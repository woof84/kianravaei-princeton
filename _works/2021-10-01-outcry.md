I tried to synthesize the incisive sounds of EDM with the gnarliest innovations of modern composition — metric modulations, modes of limited transposition, twelve-tone rows — resulting in a piece of music suitable for concert halls and raves alike.

It spotlights a mode of Iranian classical music called <i>Bidâd</i> (“outcry”), known for its visceral, wailing quality. I hear the very same primal expressive urge in <i>Bidâd</i>, modern classical works like <i>The Rite of Spring</i> (hence the bassoon quote), and the heavier strains of EDM.

<p class="teaser">When writing for bells, one cannot ignore their history as liturgical instruments, resounding with reverence for a higher spirit.</p>

And though this piece is a hymn, it is only a hymn in the sense that it is a song of praise and celebration.

_Hymn to the Hills of Westwood_ was written for the UCLA Powell Library carillon bells, and takes inspiration from UCLA's alma mater, _Hail to the Hills of Westwood_. In _Hymn to the Hills of Westwood_, the tune from UCLA's school song goes on a transformative journey. This journey begins with a fundamental problem: the song is in the wrong key. The problem is righted slowly, by degrees, and not without struggle. At times the very identity of the song appears lost, obscured, compromised.

This is not a tribute to the honorable history of this university. Nor is it a song of praise for UCLAâ€™s present accolades. It is a celebration of the trials, tribulations, and failures we steadfastly endure on the eternal path toward equity and virtue.

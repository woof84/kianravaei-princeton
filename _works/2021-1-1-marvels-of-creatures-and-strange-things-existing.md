Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century book _Marvels of Creatures and Strange Things Existing_ was the catalogue to end all catalogues. It contains descriptions of every living thing in existence — that includes not only plants and animals, but monsters and demons and gods. You will find next to a drawing of a trout a detailed depiction of a Godzilla-sized sea serpent.

My eponymous work is a set of six preludes for piano, each inspired by a creature from this strange and marvelous book.

_More recordings coming soon._
